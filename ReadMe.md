Hereâ€™s a structured documentation to create and schedule tasks and flows in Prefect based on your setup and examples.

## Prefect Installation and Environment Setup

### Create Python Virtual Environment & Install Prefect

1. **Create Python Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv prefect_env1
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - Windows:
     ```bash
     .\prefect_env1\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source prefect_env1/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Prefect:**
   ```bash
   pip install prefect
   ```

4. **Check Prefect Version:**
   ```bash
   prefect --version
   ```

5. **Log In/Log Out of Prefect Cloud (if needed):**
   ```bash
   prefect cloud logout
   prefect cloud login
   ```

6. **Start Prefect Server (Local):**
   ```bash
   prefect server start
   ```

7. **Set Prefect API URL:**
   ```bash
   prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api
   ```

## 1. Creating a Simple Prefect Task

In Prefect, a **task** is a basic unit of work, often used to perform a specific operation or function.

### Example Task: `say_hello`
```python
from prefect import task

@task
def say_hello(name: str):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

- **Explanation:** This task takes a `name` parameter and prints a greeting message.
- **Usage:** Define multiple tasks as needed to perform individual operations within a flow.

---

## 2. Creating a Simple Prefect Flow

A **flow** is a collection of tasks, defining the sequence in which the tasks should be executed.

### Example Flow: `hello_goodbye_flow`
```python
from prefect import flow

@flow
def hello_goodbye_flow(name: str):
    say_hello(name)
    say_goodbye(name)
```

- **Explanation:** This flow is defined to call both `say_hello` and `say_goodbye` tasks sequentially, greeting and then saying goodbye to the name provided.

---

## 3. Creating and Scheduling a Parameterized Prefect Flow

To allow flexibility in your workflows, you can parameterize your flows by adding arguments that can be set at runtime.

### Example: Parameterized Flow
```python
from prefect import flow, task

@task
def say_hello(name: str):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

@task
def say_goodbye(name: str):
    print(f"Goodbye, {name}!")

@flow
def hello_goodbye_flow(name: str):
    say_hello(name)
    say_goodbye(name)
```

- **Usage:** You can invoke `hello_goodbye_flow` with a specific name:
  ```python
  hello_goodbye_flow(name="Jitendra")
  ```

### Scheduling the Parameterized Flow
Use the deployment setup with an interval to schedule flows.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_goodbye_flow.serve(
        name="Demo Deployment",
        tags=["Demo"],
        parameters={"name": "Jitendra"},
        interval=60  # runs every 60 seconds
    )
```

- **Explanation:** `interval=60` schedules the flow to run every 60 seconds.

## 4. Automating and Scheduling a Prefect Flow

With Prefect, flows can be set up for periodic or event-based automation by configuring schedules. In this example, the flow is automated to run every 60 seconds as demonstrated above.
